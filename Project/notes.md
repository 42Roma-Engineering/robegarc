# Step 1: Data Preparation and Exploration
    Load the datasets:
    
    Use Pandas library in Python to read the datasets from CSV files into DataFrame objects.
    Example:
            import pandas as pd
            df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
    
    Explore the data:
    
    Check the first few rows of the DataFrame using head() method to understand the structure of the data.
    Utilize info() and describe() methods to get summary statistics and information about data types.
    Visualize distributions of features using histograms, box plots, or pair plots (seaborn library can be helpful).
    
    Handle missing or inconsistent data:
    
    Use isnull() method to identify missing values.
    Decide on a strategy for handling missing data: imputation, removal, or interpolation.
    Use methods like dropna() or fillna() to handle missing values.
    Remove irrelevant features:
    
    Identify features that do not contribute to the analysis (e.g., log type, timestamp).
    Use DataFrame's drop() method to remove irrelevant columns.
    Example:
            df.drop(['log_type', 'timestamp'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
    Select relevant features:
    
    Choose features that are likely to differentiate
    between operational states and anomalies (e.g., motor currents, arm positions).
    Consider domain knowledge and consultation with experts.
    Create new features:
    
    Engineer new features if existing ones do not fully capture the information required.
    Example: Calculate the difference between consecutive positions or currents.
    Normalize or scale features:
    
    Use StandardScaler from scikit-learn to scale features to a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
    Example:
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

            scaler = StandardScaler()
            scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Step 3: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
    Choose clustering algorithm:
    
    Decide on an appropriate clustering algorithm
    based on the data and problem requirements (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering).
    Consider scalability, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
    Determine the number of clusters:
    
    Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate their performance.
    Use methods like the elbow method or silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
    Perform clustering:
    
    Apply the chosen clustering algorithm to the scaled feature matrix.
    Example (using K-means):
            from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

            kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
            clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

# Step 4: Anomaly Detection
    Select anomaly detection algorithm:
    
    Choose an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm
    based on the data characteristics (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
    Consider the ability of the algorithm to handle high-dimensional data and its sensitivity
    to different types of anomalies.

    Detect anomalies:
    
    Fit the selected anomaly detection model to the scaled feature matrix.
    Identify anomalies based on the model's predictions.
    Example (using Isolation Forest):
            from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

            model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
            anomalies = model.fit_predict(scaled_features)

# Step 5: Evaluation
    Select evaluation metrics:
    
    Choose appropriate metrics for evaluating clustering performance (e.g., silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index)
    and anomaly detection (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
    Evaluate performance:
    
    Calculate the chosen metrics to assess the quality of the clustering and anomaly detection results.
    Compare the performance of different models or parameter settings.
    Interpret results:
    
    Interpret the evaluation results to understand the effectiveness of the solution in distinguishing
    between operational states and anomalies.
    Consider the implications of false positives and false negatives.

# Step 6: Visualization
    Visualize clustered data:
    
    Plot the clustered data in the feature space using scatter plots or heatmaps.
    Color data points according to their assigned clusters.
    Visualize anomalies:
    
    Highlight anomalies detected by the anomaly detection model using different markers or colors.
    Overlay anomalies on the scatter plot or heatmap to visualize their distribution.
    Utilize dimensionality reduction:
    
    Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA to visualize clusters and anomalies
    in lower-dimensional space if the feature space is high-dimensional.

# Step 7: Refinement and Optimization
    Iterate on the approach:

    Fine-tune parameters, adjust feature selection, or explore alternative algorithms
    based on insights gained from evaluation and visualization results.
    Experiment with different preprocessing techniques or feature engineering strategies
    to improve performance.
    Ensure scalability and robustness:
    
    Ensure the solution is scalable and robust to handle variations in data and operational conditions.
    Validate the solution on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.
